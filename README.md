![Impact Banner](./src/assets/images/CareerDay-Deutschschweiz-25_1.jpg)

**Impact In Motion** is a responsive and interactive one-page web application that transforms Powercoders’ traditional PDF impact report into a modern, engaging, and modular digital experience.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

> “The annual report is how the world sees us.”  
> This project’s goal is to make that view clearer, more dynamic, and future-proof.

Originally a static PDF document, this new format allows the public, partners, and potential applicants to **interact with Powercoders’ impact** more easily — while making future updates simpler and more accessible for non-technical users.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Responsive one-page design
- ✅ Data-driven content (JSON-based)
- ✅ Editable without coding
- ✅ Modular sections (community, bootcamp, women connect, etc.)
- ✅ Clean UI and accessible layout
- ✅ Easy extension for future years
